## 📋 Usage Examples

### Basic Payload Loading
```python
from Tools.payload_manager import PayloadManager, PayloadCategory

manager = PayloadManager()
system_payloads = manager.get_payloads_by_category(PayloadCategory.SYSTEM_DISCLOSURE)
```

### High-Effectiveness Testing
```python
high_eff_payloads = manager.get_payloads_by_effectiveness(EffectivenessLevel.HIGH)
for payload in high_eff_payloads:
    test_case = create_test_case(payload)
    results.append(run_test(test_case))
```

### Search and Filter
```python
token_attacks = manager.search_payloads("token")
latest_exploits = [p for p in manager.payloads.values() 
                  if 'latest' in p.name.lower()]
```
